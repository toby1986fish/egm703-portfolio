    "# EGM703 - Week 2 Practical: Hyperspectral image analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In the lectures and reading this week, you've learned about hyperspectral remote sensing and a number of different methods for analyzing hyperspectral data. In this practical, we'll gain some experience working with hyperspectral data, using a few examples written in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open and view data using xarray\n",
    "- Perform atmospheric correction using dark object subtraction\n",
    "- Use spectral angle matching to compare spectral signatures and identify surfaces\n",
    "- Gain some familiarity with Spectral Python (SPy), a python package for analyzing hyperspectral images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data provided\n",
    "In the `data` folder, you should have the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- combine_spectral_library.py - a python script that can be used to add additional spectra to **spectral_library.csv**\n",
    "- EO1H0380352003173110PF_MTL_L1T.TXT - the L1T (\"level-1 terrain corrected\") metadata file for the EO-1 image\n",
    "- solar_spectra.csv - a csv file containing values of extraterrestrial (top of atmosphere) radiance as a function of wavelength\n",
    "- spectral_library.csv - a csv file containing example reflectance spectra for different surface types\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to download the hyperspectral data from Blackboard, or from the Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EHJpSbkbARJ2Rt6NndBSPe9SlcYr_iO/view?usp=sharing) - be sure to save it to the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datast provided is an EO-1 Hyperion image, acquired 22 June 2003, over an area near the border of Arizona and Nevada in the southwestern United States. To prepare the dataset, I have converted the original L1T DN values to spectral radiance, then combined and re-ordered the bands (by wavelength) into a single netcdf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Getting started\n",
    "As always, we need to run the following cell to import the necessary libraries, as well as define a couple of functions that we'll use for displaying the image(s)."

    "## 2 Atmospheric Correction\n",
    "Now that we have seen a few ways to view our data, we can try to correct the radiance values for atmospheric effects. At shorter wavelengths (compared to the thermal infrared) like we have here, we tend to see more atmospheric scattering, increasing significantly towards shorter wavelengths - in particular, this makes the image appear more blue. This is owing to the main ways that electromagnetic radiation scatters off of molecules and particles in the atmosphere, something we'll address in more detail during next week's lectures.\n",

This technique is where we take the reflectance of an object (either an optically \"dark\" object, or objects in shadow) and subtract the observed radiance values for that object from the rest of the image.\n",

    "Rather than searching the image for a suitable object, we're going to use a percentile approach - taking the radiance value that is only brighter than 0.5% of the image.
